Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: identify 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This helps anchor you in the present moment when anxiety feels overwhelming.",

Try breaking your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks - what feels like a mountain becomes a series of small hills. Also, remember that taking short 5-minute breaks every hour isn't lazy; it's strategic recovery that actually improves your productivity.",

Try visualization: spend 5 minutes imagining yourself giving the presentation successfully, feeling confident, and receiving positive feedback. Also, practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique beforehand: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This activates your calm response.",

Try this: for the next minute, just notice your breathing. When your mind wanders (and it will), gently bring attention back to your breath. That's it - you're being mindful.",

Try the 'worry window' technique: set aside 15 minutes earlier in the day to write down your worries, then tell your brain 'I've already handled this today.' At bedtime, if worries arise, remind yourself of your worry window. Also, try progressive muscle relaxation - tense and release each muscle group from toes to head.",

Try the 'good enough' experiment: intentionally do something at 80% instead of 100% and notice that the world doesn't end.

      "response": "Self-worth isn't built overnight, but it is built through small, consistent actions. Try keeping a 'evidence journal' - each day, write down one thing you did well, no matter how small. Over time, you'll have concrete proof of your capabilities and worth, which is much stronger than positive thinking alone.",

Try to identify what you can control in this change and what you can't. Focus your energy on the 'can control' list - this gives you agency when everything else feels uncertain.",

Before reacting, try the 'STOP' technique: Stop what you're doing, Take a breath, Observe what you're feeling and thinking, then Proceed with intention.

      "response": "Setting boundaries isn't selfish - it's necessary for your wellbeing and actually improves relationships. Start small: practice saying 'Let me check my schedule and get back to you' instead of automatically saying yes. This gives you time to consider whether you truly want to commit.",
